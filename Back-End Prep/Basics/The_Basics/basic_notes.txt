Basics (Ruby 101)
string double quotes vs single
double allows interpolation 

irb code
a = 'ten'
"My fav num is #{a}!"
>> "My fav num is ten!"
syntax - #{ruby expression}

symbols created by using a colon before word
:name
:a_symbol
symbols are immutable(unchangeable) strings

JS vs Ruby 
primitive types = JS = integer, string, boolean
Ruby = integer, float 
when dividing use must account for decimal places unlike JS. float is required or value is rounded
Use of 1 float causes all values to be returned as float

nil? is method capable of testing an object for value
nil is interpretted as false when used in an expression (eg conditional statement)

Comparison operator == 

FixNum = Integer 

Type Conversion 
Converest a string to number using the method "to_i" 
'12'.to_i --> to integer
1221.to_s --> to string
1312312.to_f --> to float

Two Basic Datastructures
JS --> Array/Object 
Ruby
- Array --> List
- Hashes --> Dictionaries (key/value pairs)  
[1,2,3,4,5][0] <-- 0 used to access first element
Hash - {:dog => 'barks'}
--There is no specific ordering to hashes as with arrays (list)
key/value pairs seperated by commas. Retrieval is possible through keys
{:dog => "barks", :cat => "meows"}[:cat]

=> is called a 'hash rocket'
expression <-- all commands written into any CLI interprettor 
Ruby expressions always return a value (even if nil or error)

Puts vs Return
puts is a method that prints something to the screen (however does not return)
--expressions perform action but do not always return expected value
