Loops and Iterators 
-Loop = repetitive execution of some block of code
-Ruby Types
  do/while, for, while 
loop is the most basic ruby loop keywords
#Example
loop do
  put some block of code
  and  
  breakstatement 
end
-will stop after pressing Ctrl+C or inserting a break statement inside block
-break keyword allows you to get out of a loop 

-next keyword allows you to skip the next iteration of the loop.. moving to next

x = 5
loop do 
  x -= 2 
  puts x 
``if x == 1 
    next
  end
  if x == -20 
    break
  end
end

break and next can be used with all ruby iterator constructs

#While Loops 
while (some boolean expression is not met) do
  --code block
  --adjust variable 
end

#Until Loops 
until(keyword - some statement is met *boolean) do
  block of code
  modify conditional variable
end

do/while loop structure
loop do 
  puts "Do you want to quit.. enter 'Y': "
  user_input = gets.chomp
  if user_input != 'Y' 
    break
  end
end
